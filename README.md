# ParkEasy Airport Parking Project
ParkEasy Airport Parking is a bookings and slot allocation system built using Microsoft ASP.NET MVC and Entity Framework 6 Code-First.

This project was carried out over the course of 3 months as a part of my HND qualification in college.

## Project Overview
ParkEasy is situated four miles from Glasgow Airport. Air travellers leave their cars with ParkEasy and transfer to and from the airport by a ParkEasy courtesy bus.

The bookings system was computerised three years ago. Last year there was a major expansion of the parking area and the company now need to upgrade the single PC into a small network which will incorporate the allocation of a parking slot. Currently all parking data is stored on a wall chart.

The new system must incorporate a visual interface which provides fast access to bookings and availability of car slots. New services to be offered will include car valeting and car servicing.

## How To Run

- Launch the `ParkEasyV1.sln` file in Visual Studio
